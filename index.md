## Credit card default prediction

Credit card default prediction is a process in which machine learning models are employed to assess the likelihood that a credit cardholder will default on their payments. Defaulting refers to the failure to repay the credit card balance within the agreed-upon terms, leading to financial losses for the credit card issuer. By analyzing historical data and relevant features such as an individual's credit history, payment behavior, and other financial indicators, predictive models can be trained to evaluate the risk of default for new or existing credit card accounts. This predictive analysis helps financial institutions make informed decisions about lending, set credit limits, and manage risks associated with credit card transactions.
